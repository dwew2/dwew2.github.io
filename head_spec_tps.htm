<h2>Specifier-head reanalyses in the complementizer domain: 
evidence from Welsh</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<div>This article considers specifier-to-head reanalyses within the complementizer domain. Such 
reanalyses are well attested. This article focuses on one such change, the emergence of 
affirmative main-clause complementizers in Welsh (present-day Welsh <span class="cited_form">mi</span> and <span class="cited_form">fe</span>). It is 
demonstrated that these emerged from earlier preverbal subject pronouns that satisfied a V2- 
constraint in [Spec, CP]. The reanalysis proceeded via two stages, one in which the expletive 
pronoun ef(e), efo was reanalysed as an affirmative main-clause complementizer, the second 
in which all other pronouns were reanalysed as affirmative main-clause complementizers that 
showed agreement with a pronominal subject. This agreement was lost between the eighteenth 
and twentieth centuries, with different results according to dialect. These changes are 
considered in the context of other cases where new agreeing complementizers have been 
created in varieties of Dutch and German, and from the general perspective of formal 
approaches to grammaticalization and unidirectionality of change. </div>
