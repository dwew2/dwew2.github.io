<h2>The Slavonic pathway in the MPhil. in Linguistics</h2>

<p>The Slavonic pathway allows students to specialise in the linguistics of the Slavonic languages in the context of general theoretical linguistics. It aims to give students the   research skills and necessary intellectual background in Slavonic and general linguistics to allow them to pursue independent research on Slavonic linguistics. The Slavonic element of the pathway is taught by the two faculty members with research interests in Slavonic linguistics, <a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/slavonic/staff/krr22">Dr Kylie Richardson</a> (Dept. of Slavonic Studies) and <a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/ling/staff/dwew2">Dr David Willis</a> (Dept. of Linguistics). Applicants should have a good working knowledge of at least one Slavonic language.</p>

<p>In the first (Michaelmas) term, students doing the Slavonic pathway are expected to follow four lecture courses or three lecture courses and a course of directed reading. At least one of these must be in an area of general linguistics. They also participate in the general elements followed by all students doing the MPhil. in Linguistics (seminars in Linguistic Theory and Research Methods). Students are encouraged to maintain broad interests in both Slavonic linguistics and theoretical linguistics by combining a range of courses from both areas. The following courses in Slavonic linguistics will normally be available:</p>

<ul><li>History of Russian (lecture course)</li>
<li>Slavonic languages (lecture course)</li>
<li>*Russian historical syntax (directed reading)</li>
<li>*History and structure of the Bulgarian language (directed reading)</li>
<li>*Syntax of Slavonic languages (directed reading)</li>
</ul>

<p>* normally only one of these courses (by agreement between staff and students) will be available in any one year</p>

<p>Other Slavonic courses may be available by arrangement with the lecturers concerned. The list of courses in general linguistics can be found on the main page of the <a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/ling/courses/pgrad/mphil.html#structure">MPhil. in Linguistics</a>. Assessed essays are written in three of these areas. Of these, one should be in general linguistics, two in Slavonic linguistics.</p>

<p>In the second (Lent) term, students must participate in the seminar 'Topics in Slavonic linguistics', plus one (or optionally two) seminars in general linguistics. The seminar in general linguistics should normally continue one of the areas studied in Michaelmas Term. During this term, students begin work on their dissertation. This can be on any aspect of the linguistics of a Slavonic language or languages, but topics that interact with the research interests of the teaching staff are particularly welcome.</p>

<p>Further inquiries about the Slavonic pathway should be directed either to Dr Kylie Richardson or Dr David Willis.</p>
